# VELMORA — Progress Ledger

> **Source of truth for continuity.** Re-read this at the start of every session before doing anything. Update it at the end of every session. See `ROADMAP.md` for the full phase plan.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-20
**Current phase:** **🎉 CORE GAME COMPLETE — Phases 0–12 all done.** v1.0.0 is feature-complete and CI-green (verify · E2E · Lighthouse-advisory). Next stage per product direction: **the massive UX/UI redesign**, then retarget + build the **"Dark Mirrors" expansion** (`EXPANSION_BRIEF.md`). Decisions locked: monetization = free base + paid expansion (entitlement scaffold in place); distribution = web (Vercel + Traefik). See `docs/LAUNCH.md` for the launch checklist.
**Roadmap note (2026-06-20):** Per product direction, sequence is **finish core (Phases 5–12) → massive UX/UI redesign → "Dark Mirrors" expansion** (see `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md`, deferred). Phases 5–7 are deliberately kept lean since the redesign will own final visual polish; the expansion brief targets the pre-migration architecture and needs a retarget pass before it's built.
**Current branch:** `phase-1-foundation` → **PR #1** (all pushed; 98 unit + 12 E2E green)
**Baseline tag:** `v0-prototype` (the verified pre-migration prototype)
**Build/run:** `npm install` → `npm run dev` (HMR) · `npm run build` + `npm run preview` (serves `dist/` at :4173)

### Phase 1 checklist

- [x] git init + baseline commit + `v0-prototype` tag + `phase-1-foundation` branch
- [x] In-repo living ledger (`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`)
- [x] Vite + TS scaffold; CSS/script ported verbatim (toolchain green, behavior identical)
- [x] Seeded RNG at the `rng()` seam (+ 11 determinism unit tests)
- [x] Content extracted to typed modules + Zod schema + `content:validate` (the 6 checks)
- [x] Vitest unit tests + Playwright smoke (both paths) + offline E2E
- [x] `vite-plugin-pwa` (injectManifest) preserving the custom service worker
- [x] CI workflow + deploy docs (README, nginx compose → `dist/`, `vercel.json`)
- [x] Phase 1 verification — all gates green
- [~] Engine decomposition — **proceeding incrementally in Phase 2** (endings extracted); remaining `engine/`+`ui/` split continues opportunistically as systems are added.

### Phase 2 checklist (Content Engine Depth — in progress)

- [x] Engine split #1: endings → `src/engine/endings.ts` (14 branches `endingId`-tagged; AD-4) + 8 unit tests
- [x] **Story arc system** — `engine/arcs.ts` + `content/arcs.ts`; cross-phase `S.arcs` state; the 3-stage _Harbor Deal_ (ballot) arc; schema/linter extended for arcs; arc unit tests + E2E (initiates → resolves to terminal stage 99 across phases)
- [x] **Persistent NPC roster + recurring antagonist** — `engine/npcs.ts` + `content/npcs.ts`/`npc-events.ts`; `S.npcs` roster with relationship/loyalty; the antagonist is created once and is the recurring opponent every phase; `npcFx` on choices; schema/linter + units + E2E (persists across phases)
- [x] **Scandals-with-memory** — `engine/scandals.ts` + `content/scandals.ts`; latent scandals resurface as a reckoning event (bury again / confess / deny on a roll); the Harbor cover-up plants one; schema/linter + units + E2E
- [x] **Difficulty modes + per-run modifiers + scenario-of-the-day** — `content/setup.ts` + `engine/setup.ts`; 3 difficulty modes feed start stats / contest / crisis / scandal frequency; 1 seeded modifier per run; create-screen difficulty chips + a "Scenario of the Day" title button (UTC daily seed)
- [x] **Vanguard-path arc** — "The Patron's Shadow" (patronage → compromise → purge), parity with the ballot Harbor arc
- [x] **Phase 2 verification** — schema/linter cover all new content types; arc E2E on **both** paths; all gates green (51 unit/content + 10 E2E)

## Phase 1 summary (PR-style)

**What changed.** Re-platformed the single-file prototype onto **Vite + TypeScript (strict)** with a content-as-data layer, an automated test suite, and CI — without changing gameplay.

- **Toolchain:** Vite 8 + TS 6, ESLint (flat) + Prettier, `.gitattributes` (LF). `index.html` is the Vite entry; the engine moved to `src/main.js`, the design system to `src/styles.css`.
- **Seeded RNG:** `src/engine/rng.ts` (mulberry32 + xmur3, serializable state) replaces the single `rng()` seam; seed + generator state persist in the save (reproducible runs / shareable seeds). `beginCareer` reads `?seed=` / `window.__VELMORA_SEED`.
- **Content as data:** `src/content/{events,paths,traits,world,names}.ts` + `src/engine/types.ts`. `src/content/schema.ts` (Zod) + `src/content/lint.ts` enforce the 6 checks (dup ids, unresolved `then`, invalid fx/roll stat keys, unreachable `queueOnly`, `${}` in plain strings, unknown ending causes). The prototype bank passes clean.
- **PWA:** `vite-plugin-pwa` injectManifest injects the hashed-asset precache into the hand-written `src/sw.js` (kept font cache + offline nav fallback; manual `SHELL_VERSION` retired).
- **Tests:** Vitest (RNG + content, 14 tests) and Playwright (smoke both paths → ending, zero console errors; offline: SW install → network cut → reload serves shell → fresh game offline). Drives system Chrome via `channel` locally; CI uses bundled chromium.
- **CI/deploy:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (verify · e2e · lighthouse), `vercel.json`, `lighthouserc.json` (warn-only budgets), README rewritten for the build-step + `dist/` deploy.

**How verified.** `lint · typecheck · content:validate · test · format:check · build · test:e2e` all green locally. Invariants 1–6 hold (E2E proves 1–2; localStorage fallback + themes + fictional content unchanged; deploy docs updated for 6). CI not yet run (branch unpushed).

**Acceptance vs. brief.** Phase 1 acceptance ("identical gameplay; tools green; content linter passes") is **met**. The full decomposition of `src/main.js` into `engine/`/`ui/` submodules is a maintainability refinement (improves Phase 2+ authoring) and is **deferred** to a focused, E2E-guarded pass — see deferred item above. `main.js` remains a single ES module (eslint/prettier-ignored) for now.

---

## Architecture decisions (ADR-lite)

- **AD-1 — Toolchain:** Vite + TS (strict) + ES modules + content-as-data (Zod); PWA via `vite-plugin-pwa`. Trade-off accepted: a build step; deploy serves `dist/` (Vercel `vercel.json` + nginx volume `./dist`).
- **AD-2 — Service worker:** `vite-plugin-pwa` **injectManifest** wraps the hand-written `src/sw.js`; gains hashed-asset precache + auto cache-busting.
- **AD-3 — Seeded RNG:** mulberry32 (xmur3 seed) behind the existing helper names; seed + state in the save. "Identical gameplay" = identical rules/distributions.
- **AD-4 — Endings reachability:** endings computed in `evaluateEnding()`; reachability is asserted by the (future) seed sweep, and `ending` causes are linted. Lift endings to data in Phase 3.
- **AD-5 — Line endings:** `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) for clean Linux CI.
- **AD-6 — Story arcs:** arc steps are ordinary events tagged `arc:{id,stage}`, drawable only when `S.arcs[id]===stage`; choices/roll-branches advance via `arcSet:{id,stage}`. `S.arcs` persists across phases (never reset), so arcs span offices. The `ARCS` registry drives validation + the future codex.

- **AD-7 — Recurring antagonist:** the antagonist NPC is created once at career start and reused by `assignOpponent` as the contest opponent every phase (rising with you), so the rival is one continuous nemesis. Old saves fall back to the original per-phase random opponent. Content references it by the stable id `antagonist` (`KNOWN_NPC_IDS`). The antagonist's relationship feeds contest difficulty (`antagonistContestModifier`, ±15 opponent strength) and shows as a disposition on the contest screen, so `npcFx` choices carry mechanical stakes.

- **AD-8 — Scandals with memory:** choices plant latent `Scandal` records (`S.scandals`); `nextEvent` injects a "The Past Resurfaces" reckoning when one is due (chance scales with severity/heat/phase). Resolving sets status (buried/resolved/exposed) so each resurfaces at most once. Engine-injected events (`ENGINE_INJECTED_EVENT_IDS`) are exempt from the unreachable-`queueOnly` lint.

- **AD-9 — Run setup:** `S.difficulty` (Storyteller/Standard/Ironclad) scales starting stats (`applyDifficultyStart`), contest opponent strength (`oppBonus`), and crisis/scandal frequency (`crisisMult`/`scandalMult`, via a `curDifficulty()` helper). One per-run modifier is rolled from the seed (`rollModifiers`) and applied at start (`applyModifier`). "Scenario of the Day" sets `DRAFT.seed = dailySeed()` so a given date plays the same run for everyone.

- **AD-10 — Engine decomposition + sweep:** the draw engine is extracted to a pure `engine/draw.ts` (`chooseNext`) shared by `main.js` and a headless `engine/sim.ts`; `content/all-events.ts` is the single draw pool. A deterministic `sweep.test.ts` runs 50 sims/path gating repeat-rate (< 0.2), event variety (≥ 18 distinct), and ending spread (≥ 3). **Update (Session 2): the extraction is now complete** — `engine/mutate.ts` (mutation helpers + dice roll), `engine/resolve.ts` (`applyChoice`), `engine/turn.ts` (`deathCause` + `advanceTurnState`), `engine/contest.ts` (promo player/opponent strength + win chance), and `engine/state.ts` (`blankRun` factory) are all shared by the live engine and the simulator. Neither `main.js` nor `sim.ts` duplicates any gameplay logic; only caller-specific concerns stay local (main: avatars, rivals, toast, theme, rendering, interactive promotion; sim: headless control loop + choice policy). The `main.js` lint/typecheck ignores remain only because of its DOM/render layer, not engine logic.

## Open questions / flagged decisions

- **Fonts:** keep Google Fonts CDN through Phase 8; self-host + subset in Phase 9/11 (perf + EU consent).
- **`CLAUDE-FABLE-5.md`:** gitignored, left on disk (not part of the game).
- **Monetization (Phase 11):** concrete path TBD; architected behind flags regardless.

## Debug ledger

- **Offline asset cache-miss (fixed).** After the offline reload, hashed JS/CSS failed with `net::ERR_FAILED` despite being precached and the SW controlling the page. Root cause: `caches.match()` honors the stored response's `Vary` header (`vite preview` serves assets with `Vary: Accept-Encoding`), so the lookup missed offline. Fix: `ignoreVary: true` on all `caches.match` calls in `src/sw.js`. (The lone remaining offline `ERR_FAILED` is the non-precached sourcemap — benign, filtered in the test.)

## Session log

### Session 1 — 2026-06-18

- Phase 0: audited the prototype directly; wrote + got approval on the plan (`~/.claude/plans/wild-churning-lagoon.md`).
- Phase 1: delivered the full foundation (commits `9d44c9a` → `15fd210` on `phase-1-foundation`): git baseline + tag, docs ledger, Vite/TS scaffold, ESLint/Prettier, seeded RNG + tests, content extraction + Zod + linter, Vitest + Playwright smoke/offline, vite-plugin-pwa, CI + deploy docs. All gates green; behavior preserved.
- Deferred within Phase 1: full `src/main.js` engine/ui decomposition (now proceeding incrementally in Phase 2).
- Phase 2 (same session — user chose to fold the engine split in): extracted endings → `engine/endings.ts` (`881d429`); built the cross-phase **story arc system** + the Harbor Deal arc (`9c3636b`). `src/main.js` now 843 lines.
- Phase 2 cont.: **persistent NPC roster + recurring antagonist** (`d197a7f`) — antagonist carried across phases as the opponent; `npcFx` relationship meters; schema/linter + tests. 34 unit/content + 6 E2E green.
- Phase 2 cont.: **antagonist hostility wired into the contest** (`a48fe32`) — relationship shifts opponent strength ±15; disposition shown on the contest screen. 37 unit/content + 6 E2E green.
- Phase 2 cont.: **scandals-with-memory** (`c60c333`) — latent scandals resurface as a reckoning event; engine + content + schema/linter. 43 unit/content + 7 E2E green.
- Phase 2 cont.: **difficulty modes + per-run modifiers + scenario-of-the-day** (`502111f`) — `content/setup.ts` + `engine/setup.ts`; create-screen difficulty chips, seeded modifiers, daily title button. 50 unit/content + 9 E2E green.
- Phase 2 done: **vanguard "Patron's Shadow" arc** (`a39e4e2`) for path parity. **Phase 2 complete** — acceptance met (arcs initiate/resolve across phases in E2E on both paths; content linter green; all new types in the schema). 51 unit/content + 10 E2E green.

### Session 2 — 2026-06-19

- Pushed `phase-1-foundation` and opened **PR #1** (richter83-star/velmora); CI (verify · e2e · lighthouse) **green** on the foundation commit; GitGuardian clean.
- Phase 3 kicked off (`5025dea`): scalable **event-pack** structure + **content pack 1** (+12 events; bank ~50); **all-14-endings reachability gate**; arc E2E made robust to content growth (multi-seed via the `?seed=` URL hook, asserting the arc advances in at least one run). 52 unit/content + 10 E2E green.
- Engine decomposition + sweep (`cf450a4`): extracted the pure draw engine (`engine/draw.ts`, shared via `chooseNext`), single-sourced the pool (`content/all-events.ts`), built a headless simulator (`engine/sim.ts`) + a seeded sweep gate (50 runs/path: repeat-rate < 0.2, ≥18 distinct events, ≥3 endings). 62 unit/content + 10 E2E green.
- **Engine extraction finished** (`177cba4` → `14f9a1b` → `5c9f812`): unified the live engine and the simulator onto shared pure modules — `mutate` (helpers + roll), `resolve` (`applyChoice`), `turn` (`deathCause`/`advanceTurnState`), `contest` (promo strength/opponent/odds), and `state` (`blankRun`). `main.js`'s `resolveChoice`/`advanceTurn`/promotion + `sim.ts` now call the same code; orphaned imports cleaned; +9 turn/contest unit tests. 71 unit/content + 10 E2E green; the seed sweep is byte-for-byte unchanged (sim behavior preserved through the refactor).
- **Content pack 2** (`7d396c5`): +22 events (`events-pack-2.ts`) across ballot/vanguard/shared/crisis + all phases, with rolls, scandals, antagonist relationship shifts, and two delayed `then`-chains. Bank **54 → 76** (~49 eligible/path). Sweep: repeat-rate **0.013/0.022** (gate < 0.2), 49 distinct events/path, 6–8 endings. Also hardened the recurring-antagonist E2E to be content-growth-robust (multi-seed via `?seed=` + a fast `playToPhaseOrEnding` helper, replacing a brittle pinned seed). 71 unit/content + 10 E2E green.
- **Content packs 4–9 + arc-injection fix** (`5496a7a`…`931bd52`): drove the bank **96 → 251**, meeting the Phase 3 250+ target. Packs span governing dilemmas, media circus, vanguard apparatus, summits, and ~46 crises across both paths and all phases; choices feed the ending flags. Fixed a real design problem surfaced by the growing bank — authored arcs were being diluted toward invisibility, so added an **arc-progression injection** to the shared draw (entry ~0.16/turn, continue 0.35/turn), raising arc entry-surfacing ~41% → ~78% and guaranteeing started arcs reach their reckoning. Final sweep: repeat-rate 0.014/0.007, 146–147 distinct events/path. The content test now asserts the 250+ milestone. 71 unit/content + 10 E2E green throughout.
- **Content pack 3** (`a608887`): +20 events (`events-pack-3.ts`), tilted to early-game depth (phase 1 was thinnest — ballot 34→40, vanguard 30→37 eligible) plus phase-3 capstones and two crises; choices set ending-feeding flags (secret_reformer/bloody_hands/corrupt_streak/cult_building/has_network/purge_count) and add two then-chains (the boss collects; the reform circle exposed). Bank **76 → 96** (crises 13→16). Sweep: repeat-rate 0.027/0.016, 62–63 distinct/path. 71 unit/content + 10 E2E green.
- **Headline ticker** (`28fa3ce`): a fake-news newswire crawl under the HUD — `content/headlines.ts` `pickHeadlines(S)` mixes generic press satire with path/phase-flavored and state-reactive lines (high heat, active scandal, corruption, cult, etc.), rotated by the turn counter and pure (never touches the gameplay RNG). aria-hidden decorative; reduced-motion aware. E2E asserts it renders.
- **Personalized epilogue** (`b653bc0`): `engine/epilogue.ts` `buildEpilogue(S)` closes the ending screen with up to three flag-driven "Years Later…" beats + a rival-parting note + a path-flavored closer, so two runs reaching the same ending read differently. 4 unit tests; smoke asserts beats render on both paths.
- **Phase 3 acceptance — MET:** 251 validated events (100% schema-valid); cross-run repeat-rate 0.014/0.007 over 50 seeded runs/path (gate < 0.2); all 14 endingIds producible (endings unit test); fictional/non-partisan invariant held. **Phase 3 closed.**

### Session 3 — 2026-06-20

- Reviewed `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md` ("The Dark Mirrors" 3-path expansion). Verdict: sound design, but **build it after core + redesign** — it's out of roadmap sequence (core was at Phase 5/12) and, more importantly, it targets the **pre-migration single-file architecture** (`PATHS{}` literal, `openCreate`/`deathCause`/`evaluateEnding`/`renderPromotion`, `ADVISORS{}`, `SHELL_VERSION`) that no longer exists; needs a retarget pass + four gap fixes (emergent-faction wiring for new blocs, ending-cause enum/linter, `own_cult`↔`cult_building` flag reconciliation, sim/sweep wiring) before it's executable.
- Product direction set: **finish core (5–12) → massive UX/UI redesign → expansion.** Phases 5–7 kept lean (redesign owns final visuals), running continuously.
- **Closed Phase 5** with five increments (`aadbd3d` settings · `169fcea` tutorial · `853ef1a` run-summary · `ab858e6` axe+contrast+responsive). Added `@axe-core/playwright`. New E2E: settings, tutorial, axe, responsive (24 E2E total, all green; 98 unit; typecheck/build/lint green). Real WCAG 1.4.3 contrast bugs fixed at token level (kept reversible for the redesign).
- **Closed Phases 6 (lean audio) & 7 (lean art)** (`b6a7ddb`, `ff39265`); pushed Phases 1–7 to PR #1 (CI green). Set ultracode mode.
- **Closed Phase 8 (Meta-Progression & Persistence)** under ultracode: ran a design workflow (Map→Design→Synthesize blueprint) and an adversarial review workflow; implemented in 4 commits (`e72ff1a` meta+history+achievements+Records · `89ccc70` save slots · `503241e` New Game+ · `ac8ca7d` review hardening). 111 unit + 33 E2E green. (Review note: a transient API rate-limit killed 16/18 verifier subagents; those candidate findings were re-verified by hand — all false positives or lean-acceptable; the one confirmed gap was fixed.)
- **Closed Phase 9 (Performance)** under ultracode: ran a measure→plan workflow, then implemented the code-split + CI budget gate + Lighthouse gate (`854cb7f` + lighthouse commit). Initial JS parse 99.8kB→32.6kB gzip; offline intact; 111 unit + 33 E2E green. CI verified green (Lighthouse `NO_FCP` flake from `numberOfRuns:3` fixed by reverting to 1; perf+a11y gate clears ≥0.9).
- **Closed Phase 10 (Testing & QA Hardening)** (`33c9872`): engine coverage gated ≥80% in CI (per-glob thresholds), +12 branch tests, sweep enlarged to 120/path with a no-soft-lock bound, flagged on-device error reporting. 125 unit + 34 E2E green.
- **User decisions:** monetization = free base + paid expansion; distribution = web only.
- **Closed Phase 11** (`c51b244` CI-advisory-Lighthouse, `6f971cb` business): SEO/OG + robots, entitlement scaffold, privacy/terms drafts. Made the flaky Lighthouse job advisory (deterministic `npm run size` is the hard perf gate). Fixed a Vite EISDIR build break (relative `<link rel=canonical href="/">`). 127 unit + 34 E2E green; CI green.
- **Closed Phase 12** (this session): semver 1.0.0, CHANGELOG.md, docs/LAUNCH.md, full regression green. **🎉 Core game (Phases 0–12) complete.** Next: UX/UI redesign, then the expansion.
- **Final launch-readiness review** (workflow, 13 agents): 9 confirmed findings (0 refuted), 2 launch-blockers — all fixed in `55e3ba6`. Notable real catch: a literal **☭ hammer-and-sickle** in the vanguard phase-3 HUD emoji + "Politburo" ×4 (fictional/non-partisan **invariant violation** that no gate caught). Now fixed AND guarded by a new **content-safety denylist linter** (real ideology/regime/religion/symbol terms) over events + paths/traits/advisors, with regression tests. Also fixed: promotion-result + contest screens now announce/focus for screen readers; tutorial focus-trap + `inert` background; Career Log/How drawer made a real dialog (role/aria/Escape/focus); skip-link → main landmark; `safeAvatar()` guard against self-XSS from a tampered save. 129 unit/content + 34 E2E green.

## AD-15 — Content-safety is now a hard gate

`content/lint.ts` gained a denylist scan (symbols ☭/卐/卍 + real ideology/regime/institution/leader/religion terms) across event plain strings and the static `PATHS`/`TRAITS`/`ADVISORS` data; runs in `content:validate` (CI) with regression tests. This is the foundation the EXPANSION_BRIEF requires and closes the gap that let ☭/Politburo ship.

## Phase 4 — Systems Depth (complete)

Per the roadmap: faction/bloc meters, ideology axes + coalition math, treasury/economy, cabinet/advisors with loyalty, trait/perk synergies, crisis sub-decisions, term limits/approval decay. Accept: no soft-locks in auto-play; documented; unit-tested where non-trivial.

- **Ideology axes** (`22e42fc`): `engine/ideology.ts` `deriveIdeology(S)` → two axes (Rule Velvet↔Iron, Hands Clean↔Dirty) shown as a **Political Profile** on the ending. 4 unit tests.
- **Faction/bloc standings + coalition math** (`6b8710d`): `engine/factions.ts` — each path's three factions get live 0–100 meters that move EMERGENTLY from the stat deltas + flags the existing 251 events already produce (no per-event authoring). Wired through `resolve.ts` (shift on every choice) and `contest.ts` (`coalitionContestMod` feeds promotion strength — happy coalition lifts, alienated drags). HUD bloc strip + "The Coalition" ending summary. 5 unit tests; smoke asserts HUD blocs + ending coalition.
- **Approval decay / term dynamics** (`eedfbfb`): `advanceTurnState` erodes support while riding high (the cost of incumbency) and faster under scrutiny / a sour economy, with no baseline drain on weak runs. Sweep-verified (avg phase ~1.8–2.0, arcs stay reachable). 2 unit tests.
- **Trait perks** (`0bc0f9e`): `engine/perks.ts` delivers the ongoing synergy each trait advertised (orator/operator/rainmaker easier signature-stat rolls + contest edge; clean sheds scrutiny faster), hooked via `doRoll`/`promoPlayerStrength`/`advanceTurnState`. 3 unit tests.
- **Cabinet / advisors with loyalty** (`72e7cf9`, `8ef5bf0`): `engine/cabinet.ts` — at each promotion you appoint an advisor from a seeded slate (a new "cabinet" UI mode, with a decline option); each grants a passive per-turn stat lift and carries a loyalty meter that drifts with the flags your choices set. A cratered advisor (loyalty ≤ 22) **resigns and leaks** (heat hit + loses their perk), so loyalty matters. HUD loyalty chips, an ending "Your Cabinet" summary, save/resume migration, and headless auto-appointment so the sim exercises it. 7 unit tests; smoke asserts the appointment screen + HUD chip.
- **Crisis sub-decisions** (`c497c25`): a choice can carry a `sub` pointer to an event shown immediately in the same turn (no advance), distinct from delayed `then`-chains. `sub` on Choice/RollOutcome + schema + linter (`sub` refs resolve, queueOnly targets reachable); `resolve.ts` returns it, `main.js` afterResult shows it, `sim.ts` resolves it inline. `content/crisis-subs.ts` ships two crisis chains. 2 unit tests. **Phase 4 closed — all 6 systems shipped.**

## Phase 5 — UX, Onboarding & Accessibility (complete)

Per the roadmap: skippable tutorial, full settings, main menu, codex/almanac, run-summary, responsive layouts, **WCAG 2.1 AA**, annoyance budget. Accept: axe clean on key screens; Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90; keyboard-only E2E passes.

- **Accessibility foundation** (`2341354`): fixed the WCAG 1.4.4 zoom lock (dropped `maximum-scale`/`user-scalable=no`); added a skip-to-game link, a polite ARIA live region, and a `main` landmark; live announcements (new decisions, outcome + stat deltas, promotions, ending); focus moves to the heading on each screen transition with visible `:focus-visible` outlines; choices were already real `<button>`s so play is keyboard-operable. New `a11y.spec.ts` proves keyboard-only play + the live region. (Lighthouse a11y score is gated in CI.)
- **Codex / Almanac** (`e476e8c`): an in-game reference (`#screen-codex`, reached via "📖 The Almanac" on the title) that surfaces the systems — how to rule, the six stats, the four systems, and per-path sections listing each path's factions (from `content/paths`) and advisors (from `engine/cabinet`), plus the starting traits. Built from live data so it never drifts; accessible (heading focus on open, focus returned to trigger on close). New `codex.spec.ts`.
- **Settings panel** (`aadbd3d`): a `#screen-settings` reached from the title with persisted **reduce-motion** and **high-contrast** toggles (role=switch, keyboard-operable) plus a clear-saved-career action. New `velmora_settings_v1` store mirrors the save's localStorage+in-memory fallback; `applySettings()` toggles `body.force-reduce-motion`/`body.high-contrast`, `setTheme()` preserves those classes across theme swaps, and `reduced()` now also honors the setting. New `settings.spec.ts` (apply + persist-across-reload + keyboard).
- **Skippable tutorial** (`169fcea`): a 4-step accessible modal (`#tutorial`, role=dialog/aria-modal, Escape to skip, focus moved in/restored out) shown once on first career (persisted `tutorialSeen`) and replayable from Settings. Test helpers dismiss it so playthroughs aren't blocked. New `tutorial.spec.ts` (first-run + skip + no-reappear + replay).
- **Run-summary** (`853ef1a`): a "By the Numbers" recap on the ending (highest office, years served, decisions, difficulty, scandals, purges), data-driven from `S`. Smoke asserts it renders.
- **axe sweep + contrast fixes** (`ab858e6`): `axe.spec.ts` runs `@axe-core/playwright` (WCAG 2.0/2.1 A/AA) over title, settings, codex, path, create, game, and ending — **zero serious/critical**. Fixed real WCAG 1.4.3 failures surfaced by it: darkened `--accent` (#E63B5B→#CC2D4F; vanguard #E5332A→#C42A1F) so white text clears 4.5:1; pinned the small section heads (`.ideo-head`/`.coal-head`→#2F5BC8, `.rs-head`→#1A7A50) to theme-independent accessible shades (the vanguard `--accent2` is gold, which failed on cream); dark text on green delta/coalition tags; darker `.delta.down` red; dark `.muted` inside light panels. **axe must scan the settled state** — the scan neutralizes the `.screen` entrance fade, else dark text mid-fade reads as low-contrast (false positives).
- **Responsive gate** (`ab858e6`): `responsive.spec.ts` asserts no horizontal overflow at 320/375/768/1024/1440 across the key screens.
- **Main menu:** the title screen serves this role (New · Continue · How to Rule · Almanac · Settings · Scenario of the Day).
- **Phase 5 acceptance — MET:** axe clean on key screens; keyboard-only play (a11y.spec); responsive at standard breakpoints; Lighthouse a11y gated in CI. 24 E2E + 98 unit green. **Phase 5 closed.**
- **Decision-gated later phases (true blockers needing user input):** Phase 11 monetization model (product call), opt-in analytics + store packaging (credentials/services). Phase 6–7 art/audio creative direction is **no longer a near-term blocker** — they're built lean with functional defaults (synth audio, procedural art) because the post-Phase-12 redesign owns the real creative direction.

## Phase 6 — Audio & Juice (complete, lean)

- **Opt-in synth SFX** (`b6a7ddb`): a tiny Web Audio module in `main.js` (`actx()` lazy `AudioContext`, `blip()`, `sfx(name)`) plays short oscillator cues — `click` on every choice, `promote`/`fail` on the promotion result, `win`/`lose` on the ending. Gated behind a new **Sound** setting (`SETTINGS.sound`, default **off**, persisted in `velmora_settings_v1`); the context is created lazily on first use and `resume()`d (autoplay-policy safe). New `audio.spec.ts` (toggle persists across reload; sound-on playthrough raises no console errors). Default-off means every other E2E is unaffected. Ambient pads / haptics intentionally deferred to the post-Phase-12 redesign.

## Phase 7 — Art Expansion (complete, lean)

- **Avatar variety** (`ff39265`): broadened the parametric avatar generator — two new accessories (beard rendered behind the mouth so expressions still read; earring) and two hair colors — via the existing `randAvatar`/`buildAvatar` system. The generator is durable (survives a reskin); full art direction (backgrounds, cosmetics, animated emblem, icon set) is deferred to the redesign. Existing E2E exercise avatar rendering on create/game/ending; all green.

## Phase 8 — Meta-Progression & Persistence (complete)

Designed and reviewed with multi-agent workflows (a Map→Design→Synthesize blueprint, then an adversarial dimension-review with per-finding verification). Built in the blueprint's shippable increments.

- **Meta store** (`e72ff1a`): pure logic in `src/engine/meta.ts` (no I/O) — `defaultMeta`/`mergeMeta`, `recordRun`/`recordStart`, achievements catalog + `unlockAchievements`, `UNLOCKABLES` + `refreshUnlockables`, all immutable. `main.js` owns the `velmora_meta_v1` store with its **own** in-memory fallback global `window._velmoraMeta` (the three fallbacks — `_velmoraMem`/`_velmoraSet`/`_velmoraMeta` — never merge). `recordRunOutcome()` rolls the finished run into META **before** `clearSave()` in `endGame`, wrapped so a meta failure can never block the ending. 12 unit tests.
- **Records screen** (`e72ff1a`): `#screen-records` (🏅 Records on the title) — lifetime stats, an achievements grid (13, set-once; locked = dashed + 🔒), unlockables, and "Past Lives" (history ring buffer, cap 50). Built from META; axe-clean.
- **Save slots** (`89ccc70`): 3 slots at `velmora_save_v1__{0,1,2}`; the legacy bare `velmora_save_v1` is adopted as slot 0 and rewritten under the prefixed key on next save. `save/loadRaw/hasSave/clearSave` route through `activeSlot`; the save-data fallback became a per-slot map (tolerating a legacy string as slot 0). New `#screen-slots` picker (Resume / Delete / Start-in-slot). Default new-game flow stays `btn-new → path` when the active slot is free (so existing E2E/quick-start are unchanged); `quickStart` diverts to the picker only when the active slot is occupied, so an in-progress career is never clobbered.
- **New Game+** (`503241e`): one optional `ngPlus` field (GameState/BlankRunOpts, default 0 → `sim.ts` and the seed sweep untouched; one resume migration line). Win bumps `META.ngPlus.maxCleared`; a create-screen tier selector (0..maxCleared) appears once unlocked and is **hidden for daily runs** (daily is always tier 0). Effects are deterministic functions of the tier, reusing the difficulty knobs: opponent `+4·tier`, crisis/scandal `×(1+0.1·tier)`, `1+min(tier,2)` starting modifier rolls — so a given seed+tier reproduces exactly.
- **Review hardening** (`ac8ca7d`): the adversarial review confirmed one low-severity gap — `mergeMeta` didn't numerically validate stored stats — now fixed by whitelisting + coercing stat fields (tamper/garbage/future-proof); made the NG+ `maxCleared` bump immutable; added a coercion unit test and a **sandbox E2E** (localStorage fully blocked → game plays start→finish, meta falls back to its global, zero console errors). 16 of 18 verifier agents were lost to a transient API rate-limit and were re-verified by hand (all false positives or lean-acceptable).
- **Acceptance — MET:** saves persist & migrate (legacy-adoption + ngPlus migration E2E); both paths green; offline intact; **111 unit + 33 E2E** green (added meta units; records/slots/ngplus/migration/sandbox/audio E2E). **Phase 8 closed.**

## Architecture decisions (Phase 8)

- **AD-11 — Two persistence tiers:** ephemeral per-slot run saves (full serialized `S`) + a durable cross-run META store. Pure logic in `engine/meta.ts`; I/O + UI in `main.js`. Each store keeps a distinct in-memory fallback global. `S.version` remains the per-run anchor; `META.metaVersion` anchors the meta schema (additive merges, no value-gating yet).
- **AD-12 — New Game+ as a deterministic tier:** a single integer scales existing difficulty knobs; no new content, no stat-table forks. Optional field ⇒ legacy saves and the headless sweep need no changes. Disabled for daily so the shared scenario stays identical for everyone.

## Phase 9 — Performance (complete)

Measured first (a measure→plan workflow): the build was one monolithic JS chunk **~99.8 kB gzip**, of which the 251-event bank was **~67.6 kB (~68%)** — and it parsed before the title screen even painted, though title/menu need none of it. zod already tree-shakes to 0 bytes; the win was code-splitting + a budget gate, not manual tree-shaking.

- **Lazy event bank** (`854cb7f`): removed 4 dead content imports (`ARC_EVENTS`/`NPC_EVENTS`/`SCANDAL_EVENTS`/`PACK_1`) that pinned data to the entry chunk, then replaced the static `content/all-events` import with `loadBank()` (dynamic `import()`, cached). `startCareer`/`resumeGame` are now `async` and `await loadBank()` before the first event; the chunk is **prefetched on title idle** (`requestIdleCallback`) so career start is instant. Result: a separate `all-events-*.js` chunk (**67.3 kB gzip**, lazy) and an entry chunk down to **32.6 kB gzip** — a ~67% cut to initial JS parse, same total transfer. The lazy chunk is auto-precached by the SW (`injectManifest` globs include js; verified it's in the precache manifest), so **offline start still works** (offline E2E green).
- **CI bundle-budget gate** (`854cb7f`): zero-dep `scripts/check-size.mjs` (`npm run size`) gzips the built assets and **fails** when the initial entry chunk > 70 kB, total JS > 300 kB, or CSS > 30 kB (warns on a large non-entry chunk / CSS). Added to the CI verify job after build — locks the win in and prevents regression as the expansion adds packs 10+.
- **Lighthouse gate** (`<this commit>`): flipped `lighthouserc.json` performance + accessibility to **error ≥0.9** (from warn 0.8/0.9) with `numberOfRuns: 3` to cut runner variance; renamed the CI job. (Verified on the CI Lighthouse job after push.)
- **Acceptance — MET:** initial JS within budget and enforced; offline + installable intact; 60fps unaffected (no runtime-hotspot changes needed — the win was the data split); **111 unit + 33 E2E** green. **Phase 9 closed.**

## Architecture decisions (Phase 9)

- **AD-13 — Content is lazy data, engine is eager:** the engine already took the event pool as a parameter (`chooseNext(S, EVENTS, …)`), so the bank splits cleanly at the data boundary with no engine refactor. One dynamic-import seam at `content/all-events` (not per-pack) keeps it simple; both paths and the headless sim still share one pool (sim keeps a static import for the deterministic sweep). The SW precaches the lazy chunk, so code-splitting never costs offline capability.

## Phase 10 — Testing & QA Hardening (complete)

The engine was already past the bar (95.4% stmts / 82.3% branch / 98.3% lines) — Phase 10 **locks it in** and hardens the sweep.

- **Coverage gate** (`33c9872`): `vitest.config.ts` now sets per-glob thresholds — `src/engine/**` must hold **statements 90 · branches 80 · functions 90 · lines 90** (content is data, not gated). CI's verify job runs `npm run test:cov` (replacing `npm test`) so the threshold is enforced. Added `tests/unit/engine-branches.test.ts` (+12) covering the weakest fallback branches in `factions`/`cabinet`; engine branch 82.3→**84.4%**.
- **Enlarged + hardened sweep** (`33c9872`): `sweep.test.ts` now runs **120 seeds/path** (was 50) and adds a **no-soft-lock** assertion (max draws < 300, well under the sim's 600-draw safety guard) on top of the existing every-run-reaches-an-ending / repeat-rate / variety / ending-spread gates.
- **Flagged error reporting** (`33c9872`): an opt-in (`SETTINGS.errorReports`, default **off**) on-device collector — `window`/`unhandledrejection` listeners record sanitized messages to a capped ring buffer (no network; there is no backend — this is the scaffold a future endpoint would drain). Settings toggle + `error-reporting.spec.ts` (off-by-default, records-when-on, persists).
- **Skipped (deliberate):** visual-regression baselines — a full UX/UI redesign after Phase 12 would immediately invalidate them; revisit post-redesign.
- **Acceptance — MET:** engine coverage ≥80% enforced in CI; large seeded sweep green incl. no-soft-lock; **125 unit + 34 E2E** green. **Phase 10 closed.**

## Architecture decisions (Phase 10)

- **AD-14 — Gate logic, not data:** coverage thresholds target `src/engine/**` only. Event packs are data whose meaningful coverage comes from the seed sweep + E2E, so per-line unit thresholds on `content/**` would be noise. The sweep (now 120/path) is the real behavioral safety net; the no-soft-lock bound turns "every run ends" into an enforced invariant.

## Phase 11 — Business, Distribution & Legal (complete, lean/web)

Per product decisions: monetization = **free base + paid expansion**; distribution = **web only** for now.

- **Monetization scaffold** (`6f971cb`): `MetaState.entitlements.expansion` + `isExpansionUnlocked(meta)` in `engine/meta.ts` (default unlocked — no purchase flow yet; no pay-to-win). `mergeMeta` normalizes it; unit-tested. This is the seam the future expansion paths gate on.
- **SEO / Open Graph** (`6f971cb`): OG + Twitter card meta, keywords/author in `index.html` (root-absolute public image paths; absolute canonical/og:url finalized at launch when the domain is set — relative `href="/"` breaks Vite's HTML asset resolver, EISDIR), plus `public/robots.txt`.
- **Legal drafts** (`6f971cb`): `docs/legal/PRIVACY.md` + `TERMS.md` — privacy-first (no backend, no trackers, on-device data; Google Fonts CDN noted), fiction/satire disclaimer, no-pay-to-win. UI links deferred to the redesign.
- **Deferred (decision/credential-gated):** native store packaging (TWA/MS Store/itch); real purchase flow; opt-in third-party analytics (chosen: none — privacy-first); i18n (after redesign).
- **CI reliability fix** (`c51b244`): the Lighthouse job is now **advisory** (`continue-on-error`) because LHCI headless intermittently reports `NO_FCP` here (the app paints fine in Playwright; bundle is within the enforced budget). The hard perf gate is the deterministic `npm run size`; a11y is hard-gated by the axe E2E.

## Phase 12 — Launch Readiness (complete)

- **Release artifacts:** semver bump to **1.0.0** (`package.json`; the app `VERSION` was already 1.0.0), a structured `CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/LAUNCH.md` (pre-merge / deploy / post-deploy checklist).
- **Full regression:** lint · typecheck · content-validate · coverage-gated unit (127) · build · size budget · **34 E2E** (smoke both paths, offline, a11y/axe, responsive, slots, records, ngplus, migration, sandbox, audio, error-reporting) — all green; CI green on every push.
- **Lighthouse note:** all-≥90 is to be confirmed against the **production URL** at deploy (CI's static LHCI run is advisory due to the `NO_FCP` flake; the bundle budget enforces the perf cost deterministically). Captured in `docs/LAUNCH.md`.
- **Deploy:** `vercel.json` + the Traefik/nginx recipe (README) verified; actual `--prod` deploy + custom domain are the human launch step.

## Dark Mirrors Expansion — Phase 1 (Foundation) — complete

Retargeted the `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md` to the live TS architecture via a design workflow (map → blueprint, gap-fixes resolved against real code), then shipped the foundation phase: **all five paths are now selectable and playable.**

- **Types widened (forcing function):** `PathKey` += `iron|gilded|anointed` (`engine/types.ts`); `PromoConfig.type` += `purge|acquisition|council`; `EndingCause` += 6 (`arrested|dissolved|indicted|hostile_takeover|excommunicated|schism`). Kept the Zod source-of-truth in lockstep: `schema.ts` `PATH_KEYS` + `ENDING_CAUSES` widened identically.
- **Registry:** 3 `PATHS` entries (`content/paths.ts`) with the brief's stat-remaps / start stats / factions / phase arcs / opponent pools. The `Record<PathKey,…>` shapes compile-forced completeness across `factions.ts` (3 BLOCS — gap-fix #1, statWeights/warm chosen so the ending-trigger blocs _industrialists/old_money/reformists_ can provably cross 70), `cabinet.ts` (12 advisors), `npcs.ts` (`ANTAGONIST_ROLE`).
- **Contest + death + endings:** `promoPlayerStrength` branches for purge/acquisition/council (`contest.ts`); `deathCause` → per-path heat/support cause maps (`turn.ts`); 6 new failure-ending branches with the brief's NEUTRALIZED/COLLAPSED/INDICTED/OUTBID/EXCOMMUNICATED/FLOCK-DIVIDED text (`endings.ts`) — gap-fix #2. `sim.ts` loss-cause map kept in lockstep with `main.js promoLossCause` (gap-fix #4 prerequisite). Flag reconciliation (gap-fix #3): **reuse** existing `own_cult`/`cult_building` — no new flags, no rename.
- **UI layer (`main.js`):** `promoBoosts` 3 new branches; per-promo-type run-button + result-copy maps; `openCreate` → 5-way `CREATE_COPY` lookup; loss routing via `promoLossCause()`; imported `isExpansionUnlocked` and wired the path-card lock seam (default unlocked → no behavior change).
- **Shell:** 3 riso path-card handbills + "The Dark Mirrors" separator in `#screen-path` (`index.html`, with non-denominational inline SVG icons); `.path-card.iron/.gilded/.anointed` `--rp-*` token blocks + separator styling reusing the AA-checked theme inks (`styles.css`).
- **Tests:** endings reachability now 20 ids (6 new failure causes); new contest-coefficient + per-path death-cause assertions; factions reachability proof per new path; new `expansion.spec.ts` E2E (5 cards + separator visible; all 3 new paths start → resolve to a tagged ending, zero console errors).
- **Gate (all green):** lint · typecheck · content:validate (incl. denylist over the new names/statNames/factions/advisors) · coverage-unit **134** (engine aggregate ≥ thresholds) · build · size (CSS 7.7 kB, entry 37.5 kB) · **38 E2E** · sweep (still 2-path this phase). With no seed events yet, a new-path run resolves through its promotions (empty draw pool → `chooseNext` returns `promotion`) — no soft-lock.
- **Next (Phase 2):** per-path seed event banks (`events-iron/gilded/anointed.ts`, 12 each + shared crises), wired into `ALL_EVENTS`; widen sweep to 5 paths in Phase 3 once each path reaches ≥4 ending ranks.

## Dark Mirrors Expansion — Phase 2 (Seed Events) — complete

Authored the per-path seed event banks via a verified parallel workflow (3 authors, one per path → adversarial schema/lint/content-safety review per bank), then hand-wrote the shared crises and wired everything into the draw pool. **39 new events** total; all five paths now play with real, path-flavored content.

- **Banks:** `events-iron.ts` (`IRON_EVENTS`, 12), `events-gilded.ts` (`GILDED_EVENTS`, 12), `events-anointed.ts` (`ANOINTED_EVENTS`, 12) — each following the brief's required ids/phases/weights/art, the exact `EventSchema`, and the house style (string|`(S)=>` bodies, `(S)=>` speakers via `S.opp`, rolls for risk/reward). Plus hand-written `events-shared.ts` (`SHARED_CRISES`, 3: `xp_popular_uprising`/`xp_foreign_embargo`/`xp_internal_betrayal`, `paths:[iron,gilded,anointed]`, written path-agnostically so the prose reads across all three stat vocabularies). 8 crisis events total (≥2 per path).
- **Finale wiring (the point of this phase):** choices spread the bloc warm/cool flags + finale-feeding flags so Phase 3's endings become reachable — e.g. iron sets `bloody_hands`/`purge_count`/`dark_money`+`owes_donor` (→ industrialists→PUPPET); gilded sets `secret_reformer` (→ PHILANTHROPIST) and `dealmaker`/`clean_streak`/`has_biographer` (→ old_money→FIGUREHEAD); anointed sets `own_cult` (→ ORACLE), `secret_reformer` (→ SAINT), `bloody_hands`/`purge_count` (→ INQUISITOR). No advisor-hire events (the brief's pre-migration pattern is obsolete — appointment is automatic via `offerCabinet`/`advisorSlate` at promotions).
- **Adversarial review caught** one real-world allusion the regex denylist missed (a "TED talk" branded reference in `gr_monopoly_hearing`) → reworded to "keynote"; and integration caught one ASCII-apostrophe-in-single-quoted-string parse error (`public's`) → fixed.
- **Validation hardening:** `tests/content/validate.test.ts` now imports `ALL_EVENTS` (single source of truth) instead of an explicit pack list, so the Zod schema + linter + content-safety denylist now provably cover the new banks (and any future ones) — previously the test enumerated packs and would have skipped them.
- **Gate (all green):** typecheck · lint · content:validate (Zod + lint + denylist over the **full** pool incl. new banks) · coverage-unit 134 · build · size (entry unchanged 37.5 kB; lazy `all-events` chunk 67.2→80.9 kB gzip, total JS 118 kB ≪ 300; CSS 7.7 kB) · **38 E2E** (the 3 new paths now play to an ending with events firing, zero console errors). Sweep still 2-path (flips to 5 in Phase 3).
- **Next (Phase 3):** the 21 bespoke finale endings (7 per new path) in `endings.ts`, start-stat/weight tuning, and flipping the reachability sweep to all 5 paths (assert ≥4 ending ranks/path).

## Dark Mirrors Expansion — Phase 3 (Endings + Tuning) — complete

Designed + adversarially reachability-verified the per-path finale endings via a workflow (3 design agents → 3 skeptical reviewers, one per path), then implemented, tuned against a live seed sweep, and proved reachability. **All five paths now resolve to their own bespoke finale ranks**, and the reachability sweep covers all five.

- **18 path-specific finale (win-state) ranks** added to `engine/endings.ts` as three ordered first-match helpers — `ironFinale` (ARCHITECT/DESPOT/PUPPET/STRONGMAN/WRECKAGE/WARLORD-default), `gildedFinale` (DYNASTY/MONOPOLIST/PHILANTHROPIST/FIGUREHEAD/WRECKAGE/PROPRIETOR-default), `anointedFinale` (SAINT/INQUISITOR/ORACLE/REFORMER/CARETAKER/SHEPHERD-default). The brief's other per-path ranks (MARTYR=`dissolved`, INDICTED=`indicted`, SCHISMATIC=`schism`, plus the heat-deaths) are the **failure causes already shipped in Phase 1**, so the finale block is 6 win-state ranks/path.
- **Integration fix (load-bearing, flagged by review):** the finale dispatch branches on `S.path` **before** the generic ballot/vanguard chain — the iron/anointed clean routes set `secret_reformer`/`peacemaker`, which the generic reformer branch would otherwise have stolen, mislabeling expansion winners. ballot/vanguard fall through to the unchanged generic chain.
- **Tuning (driven by the live sweep + an adversarial probe):** relaxed iron PUPPET `influence<45→<50` and gilded DYNASTY `base>=65→>=60` (no passive base drift), added `funds<60` to gilded PHILANTHROPIST so a funds-rich high-`old_money` line falls through to FIGUREHEAD. Fixed a **dead anointed gate** the reviewer caught (CARETAKER `composite<=80` vs a starting composite of ~160 — could never fire; observed finale composites are 239–317) and reordered the anointed block on principle: a SAINT must have **clean hands** (`!bloody_hands`), and your institutional identity (ORACLE cult / REFORMER coalition) is read **before** a merely quiet `purge_count>=3` collapses everything back into INQUISITOR.
- **Reachability proven two ways:** `tests/unit/endings.test.ts` constructs an end state for **each of the 18** new ranks and asserts the exact `endingId` (+ distinctness); the seed sweep is the variety gate. Under random play every new path clears **≥4 distinct ending ranks** (iron 6, gilded 6, anointed 4 — the theocracy legitimately polarizes into saint/inquisitor, with the rarer ranks proven reachable by the unit test).
- **Sweep flipped to all 5 paths** (`tests/unit/sweep.test.ts`, 120 seeds/path): per-path thresholds (base paths keep the ≥18-distinct-event floor; expansion paths use ≥10 for their ~15-event banks), **≥4 distinct ending ranks for every path**, plus the existing no-soft-lock / repeat-rate / every-run-ends gates.
- **Gate (all green):** typecheck · lint · content:validate (Zod + lint + denylist; the new ending prose is fictional/non-partisan by construction) · **coverage-unit 154** (engine aggregate ≥ thresholds; +2 expansion-finale reachability tests, sweep now 5-path) · build · size (entry within budget, total JS 123.6 kB ≪ 300; CSS 7.7 kB) · **E2E** expansion (4) + smoke (5) green — all 3 new paths start→ending with zero console errors and the base paths' endings are unaffected.
- **Next (Phase 4 — Polish + Pack Framing):** `EXPANSION_README.md` (the three paths, mechanical differences, content-safety statement), the path-select expansion separator polish, bump the SW shell version, and a full regression (Lighthouse/axe/seeded E2E) across all paths.

## Dark Mirrors Expansion — Phase 4 (Polish + Pack Framing) — complete

The expansion's framing + final regression pass. **The Dark Mirrors is feature-complete** — all five paths play start-to-finish to their own bespoke endings, content-safe and AA-clean.

- **`EXPANSION_README.md`** (repo root, alongside `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md`): the pack overview — what the three paths are, a how-they-differ breakdown (stat remaps, start stats, factions, promotion mechanic, the six finale ranks + two failures per path), the **content & safety statement** (the non-negotiable fiction/non-partisan contract + the enforced denylist), the free-base/paid-expansion distribution note, and a developer map of where the expansion lives in the code.
- **Path-select separator polished** (`index.html` + `styles.css`): the plain left-aligned dashed line became a centered, **rule-flanked "printed intermission"** — the title moved to the bright `--paper` ink with gold used only for the decorative ≥3px flanking bars (per the foil token's own "decorative/large only" rule), which also tightened the contrast posture. Sub-label title-cased to "Expansion Pack · Three Darker Roads"; aria-label expanded. Markup change is content-only (the `.path-sep` hook the E2E asserts is preserved). Verified visually + axe-clean.
- **Obsolete brief items, deliberately skipped:** the SW `SHELL_VERSION` bump (the service worker is intentionally **unversioned** — `vite-plugin-pwa` content-hashes assets; manual versioning was retired in Phase 1, AD-2) and the `COMMERCIAL_BRIEF.md` update (that file doesn't exist in this repo; the eight-paths framing lives in `EXPANSION_README.md`).
- **Full regression — all green:** typecheck · lint · content:validate (Zod + lint + denylist) · **154 unit** (coverage thresholds; endings reachability + 5-path sweep) · build · size (entry within the 70 kB budget, total JS within 300) · **38 E2E** — smoke (both base paths), expansion (5 roads + all 3 new paths to a tagged ending, zero console errors), **axe** (path screen incl. the restyled separator — zero serious/critical), **responsive** (320–1440, no overflow), plus arcs/npc/scandals/slots/records/ngplus/migration/sandbox/audio/settings/tutorial. Lighthouse stays the advisory/production-URL step (the deterministic `npm run size` is the hard perf gate; a11y is hard-gated by axe) per `docs/LAUNCH.md`.

### Dark Mirrors invariants (re-verified)

1. All **five** paths play start-to-finish with zero E2E errors. ✓
2. Content-safety **denylist** passes with zero hits over the full pool + path/faction/advisor/ending data. ✓
3. PWA stays **installable + offline-capable** (offline E2E green; SW unchanged). ✓
4. The cartoon/riso visual identity is preserved + extended — the three themes reuse the same token system, fonts, and card/gauge/avatar components. ✓
5. No real ideology / religion / nation / party / living-person name or banned symbol appears in any player-visible string. ✓

**The "Dark Mirrors" expansion (Phases 1–4) is complete.** Remaining are the human launch steps (merge PR #1, tag, deploy, production-URL Lighthouse) and the deferred real purchase flow against the `entitlements.expansion` seam.

## AI Director — on-device adaptive replayability (Layer 0) — complete

Designed via a workflow (3 map agents → a 4-approach design panel: on-device director / generative grammar / adaptive nemesis / opt-in BYOK LLM → 4 adversarial evaluators → synthesis). The synthesis recommended a **layered** plan: ship a fused on-device "Director core" first (safe by construction — pure, seeded, offline, denylist-clean), then an on-device generative grammar (Layer 1), with an opt-in BYOK online LLM as the one genuine fork (Layer 2). **Layer 0 is built.**

- **What it is:** an on-device "AI Director" (a Left-4-Dead-style director fused with an adaptive nemesis) that reads the player's revealed playstyle each turn and reshapes the run from the **existing** event bank — zero generated text, so it sidesteps the hardest invariant (AD-15 content-safety) by construction. Three compounding effects: (1) **playstyle-targeted selection** — events resonant with how you govern surface more, so a dealmaker and a clean reformer walk different paths through the same pool; (2) **dynamic pacing** — a tension sawtooth (build→spike→relief) modulates crisis/scandal/arc injection instead of flat constant odds; (3) **adaptive nemesis** — the rival commits to a doctrine (saboteur / coalition-raider / muckraker / institutionalist / opportunist) read from your weakest stat / alienated bloc / worst scandal, biasing which dilemmas appear and how hard it fights at the contest.
- **Architecture (pure, shared, seeded):** new `src/engine/director/**` — `tags.ts` (per-event thematic fingerprint derived once from each event's `fx`/`set`, cached, no authoring), `playstyle.ts` (`buildVector(S)` → normalized 7-axis vector), `tension.ts` (`tension`/`targetCurve`), `nemesis.ts` (`planNemesis`), `index.ts` (`makeDirector(S)` + `nemesisContestEdge`). Hook: an optional `director` on `DrawOpts` consumed by `chooseNext` via a new `weightedPickScored` + injection scaling — **default `undefined` ⇒ byte-identical to pre-director** (same rng consumption). The director is a pure function of `S` (no rng, no new persisted state, no migration), so the seed still reproduces a run exactly. The contest's flat `±15` hostility feed is replaced by `nemesisContestEdge(S)` inside the existing 20–90 / 4–96 clamps.
- **Bounds (sweep-verified):** per-event multiplier clamped `[0.25, 4]` and never zero (no event becomes undrawable); injection scaling clamped `[0.55, 1.8]` (no soft-lock). The 5-path seeded sweep now runs **both director-OFF (regression) and director-ON (shipped default)**, 120 runs/path each — all gates hold (every run ends, repeat-rate ≤0.018 ≪ 0.2, distinct-event floor, no soft-lock, **≥4 distinct ending ranks/path**). The director even _improved_ anointed's thin margin (4→5 ranks, surfacing `anointed_reformer`).
- **Settings:** one opt-in toggle `aiDirector`, **default ON** (it's 100% local — no network, no key, no privacy surface; OFF = the classic shuffle). Wired into the existing `velmora_settings_v1` store + an accessible switch row in `#screen-settings` with a privacy-clear blurb.
- **Gate (all green):** typecheck · lint · content:validate · **197 unit** (+13 director tests + the dual-mode sweep; `engine/director` 98.5% stmts / 100% lines, engine aggregate ≥ thresholds) · build · size (entry within the 70 kB budget; total JS within 300) · **38 E2E** (smoke both base paths, expansion, axe incl. the new settings switch, settings/a11y, the antagonist-across-phases test — all green with the director default-ON).
- **Deferred (the layered plan):** Layer 1 — **Loom**, an on-device generative event grammar (parameterized templates × state-bound slots, denylist-checked at build + fill) that multiplies content within the bundle budget. Layer 2 — **Live Storyteller**, an opt-in, default-OFF, bring-your-own-key online LLM enrichment layer (every generated string schema- + denylist-validated before display; full offline fallback) — the one fork that adds a network call + secret surface, awaiting an explicit product decision.

## Loom — on-device generative event grammar (Layer 1) — complete

Layer 1 of the layered AI-replayability plan: an on-device combinatorial content engine that weaves state-bound dilemmas from a small authored skeleton set, dissolving the finite-bank ceiling while staying 100% offline, deterministic, and denylist-safe.

- **Shared denylist (`src/content/denylist.ts`):** extracted the content-safety regexes into one source — **CORE** (the original gate; `lint.ts` re-imports it, so static content is held to exactly today's bar — zero regression) and **STRICT** (CORE + a much broader net: real nations/parties/institutions/figures/faiths) for the open LLM layer. Plus `scanRealizedText(ev, {strict?})`, the runtime validator both generative layers reuse.
- **Grammar engine (`src/engine/grammar/**`, pure):** `slots.ts`(state slots — your rival + disposition, weakest/strongest lever in path vocabulary, most-alienated/most-loyal faction — all re-derivable from S),`lexicons.ts`(small fictional noun banks),`weave.ts` (`weaveTemplate`/`realize`/`reweave`). A realized event is gated through the production **Zod schema AND the CORE denylist** before it can be returned; either failure → `null` → the caller falls through to an ordinary draw (generated text never reaches the DOM unvalidated, and a failed weave can't soft-lock).
- **Templates (`src/content/templates.ts`):** 10 rich, state-bound skeletons (rival moves, the bloc you've neglected organizing, pressure on your weakest lever, a loyal faction's price, a rival overture, etc.). Tokens fill **text only**; each choice's `fx` is authored fixed, so effect always matches narrative. Choices set real flags, so woven events feed the director/factions/endings machinery.
- **Reproducibility (closes the killer objection):** the rng picks are encoded into the woven event's id (`tpl.id#i.j.k`); state slots re-derive from S. `main.js` registers each woven event into the live pool + persists it in `S.wovenCache`, and `resumeGame` re-adds it — so a mid-woven-event save/reload rehydrates the exact event (`EVENTS.find` resolves it). A reload-race the new second import exposed was fixed by folding TEMPLATES into the existing `all-events` lazy chunk (one dynamic import, prefetch-warmed).
- **The combinatorial safety gate (`tests/content/weave-safety.test.ts`):** ENUMERATES (not samples) every lexicon-pick combination × all paths/phases × a state matrix covering every slot value — **>1000 realizations** — and asserts each is schema-valid, CORE-denylist-clean, and grammatically intact (no orphan tokens, no double spaces). This is what makes the combinatorial-content-is-safe claim sound.
- **Determinism / sweep:** woven events ride the shared `chooseNext` seam; the 5-path sweep's "AI" variant now runs **Director + Loom together** (the shipped default). Metrics count **base template ids** (not woven composite ids) so variety can't be inflated dishonestly — distinct events on the expansion paths rose 16→26, repeat-rate stays ≤0.029 ≪ 0.2, ≥4 ending ranks/path, no soft-lock.
- **Settings:** a "Story Weaver" toggle (`weaveDensity` off/low, default **low**) with an accessible switch + privacy-clear blurb.
- **Gate (all green):** typecheck · lint · content:validate (10; incl. the exhaustive weave-safety gate) · **206 unit** (`engine/grammar` 96.9% stmts/100% lines) · build · size (entry within 70 kB; total JS 150 kB ≪ 300) · **38 E2E**.
- **Next:** Layer 2 — **Live Storyteller**, the opt-in BYOK online LLM enrichment (default OFF; every generated string schema- + STRICT-denylist-validated before display; engine-never-imports-live CI guard; offline fallback).

## 🎉 Core game complete

Phases 0–12 are done. **Next stage:** the massive UX/UI redesign (which will own final visual polish — Phases 5–7 were intentionally kept lean for this reason), then retarget the `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md` to the current TS architecture and build the "Dark Mirrors" expansion.

## Next steps (concrete)

1. **UX/UI redesign (next stage):** the massive redesign that 5–7 were kept lean for. Establish the visual direction (palette, type, layout, motion), then reskin screens on the existing token system. Durable layers (engine, persistence, a11y structure, content) carry over untouched.
2. **Then the expansion:** retarget `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md` to the TS architecture (it targets the pre-migration single-file `PATHS{}`/`ADVISORS{}` shape) + the four gap-fixes recorded in Session 3, then build the three "Dark Mirrors" paths and wire the real purchase flow to the `entitlements.expansion` seam.
3. **Launch (human steps):** merge PR #1 → `main`, tag `v1.0.0`, deploy `--prod` + custom domain, run Lighthouse on the production URL (see `docs/LAUNCH.md`).
4. At a checkpoint: keep `phase-1-foundation` pushed so **PR #1** CI runs (verify · e2e · lighthouse). (Optional, low priority: retire the `src/main.js` lint/typecheck ignores by extracting the UI layer → `ui/`.)
5. **After Phase 12:** the massive UX/UI redesign, then retarget + build the `EXPANSION_BRIEF.md` expansion.
